# Dessert Recipe Sharing App

This is a Dessert Recipe Sharing App built on Ruby on Rails, an open-source web application framework built on the Ruby programming language. It is one of the best frameworks available for building web applications.

On this platform, we allow users to create an account in order to post recipes on our platform. These recipes are categorized into types of dessert recipes. Site visitors can view the recipes, share them, and add comments.

## Requirements

The first requirement is to install Ruby and Rails. Follow this link to learn how to  - [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/).

## Create a new rails application

The first step is to create a new rails application in your terminal. This is done by entering the command below:

```rails
$ bin/rails new project_name
```
where project_name is the name of your application.

This will create a Rails application in the directory you supplied 'project_name', and will automagically install the gem dependencies that are needed to get your application running.

## Install Gems

Next, in your terminal, run `$ bin/bundle install` to get gems installed.

## Generate Models

Generate models by running the command below

```rails
$ bin/rails generate model model_name
```
where model_name is the name of the model you would like to create.
